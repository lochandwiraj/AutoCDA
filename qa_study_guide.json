    "question": "How does it handle complex multi-stage circuits?",
    "answer": "Great question. The current MVP focuses on single-stage circuits to prove the concept. For multi-stage designs, the system would need hierarchical DSL representation, which is definitely on the roadmap. Right now, a user could generate each stage separately and manually connect them, but full automation of complex topologies is a future milestone.",

  "nlp_accuracy": {
    "question": "What if the NLP misinterprets the circuit description?",
    "answer": "We handle this through validation and explainability. The system validates the generated circuit against basic electrical rules and shows the user exactly what it understood. If the interpretation seems wrong, the explanation makes it obvious\u2014for example, if it calculated a 10k\u03a9 resistor but you expected 1k\u03a9, you'd see the formula and catch the discrepancy.",

  },
  "existing_tools": {
    "question": "Why not use tool X instead?",
    "answer": "Tools like EasyEDA have AI features, but they typically assist with existing designs or PCB layout. AutoCDA is unique because it starts from pure natural language\u2014no schematic needed. It's focused on the earliest design stage: translating intent into a first draft. It's complementary to existing tools, not a replacement.",

  "component_accuracy": {
    "question": "How accurate are the component values?",
    "answer": "Component values are calculated using standard electrical formulas\u2014for example, RC filters use fc = 1/(2\u03c0RC). The system then rounds to standard E12 or E24 series values, just like an engineer would. In testing, theoretical vs. actual cutoff frequencies match within 5%, which is typical for real-world component tolerances.",

  "analog_digital": {
    "question": "Can this handle analog and digital circuits?",
    "answer": "The current version focuses on analog passive circuits because they have well-defined formulas. Digital circuits require logic synthesis, which is a different problem space. That said, the architecture is extensible\u2014the DSL could be expanded to include digital components, and the SKiDL library supports them. It's definitely a future direction.",

  "pcb_layout": {
    "question": "What about PCB layout?",
    "answer": "PCB layout is the natural next step. The groundwork is there\u2014we already generate schematics with connectivity information. The challenge is automating component placement and routing, which requires spatial reasoning beyond just circuit topology. That's a significant research problem but absolutely on the roadmap.",

  "safety": {
    "question": "How do you ensure the generated circuits are safe?",
    "answer": "Safety is built into the validation layer. The system checks for common issues like floating nodes, unrealistic voltage levels, and component ratings. For power circuits, we'd need additional rules\u2014current limits, thermal constraints, etc. The MVP prioritizes low-voltage signal circuits, but the validation framework is designed to be extensible for safety-critical applications.",

  "business_model": {
    "question": "What's the business model?",
    "answer": "There are several paths: a freemium SaaS with advanced features, API access for engineering teams, or integration with component suppliers for referral fees. The core value is saving engineering time\u2014if we can compress hours into seconds, there's clear ROI for professional users. The MVP is open-source to validate demand.",

  "simulation": {
    "question": "Does it run circuit simulations?",
    "answer": "The current MVP generates simulation-ready netlists that can be opened in KiCad and simulated with Ngspice. Automated simulation with result visualization is on the immediate roadmap. The foundation is there\u2014we have the netlist format\u2014we just need to add the testbench generation and plotting layer.",

  "learning_curve": {
    "question": "Who is the target user?",
    "answer": "Three groups: beginners learning circuit design without EDA expertise, engineers doing rapid prototyping who want to skip manual schematic entry, and educators who can use the explainability feature to teach circuit fundamentals. The system meets users where they are\u2014natural language\u2014and guides them to working designs.",
