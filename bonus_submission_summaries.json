    "title": "Innovation: NLP-to-Schematic Automation",
    "description": "AutoCDA is the first system to convert pure natural language into production-ready electronic schematics without manual intervention. Unlike existing EDA tools that require component placement and wiring, AutoCDA automates the entire early design phase through a novel multi-stage AI pipeline (NLP \u2192 DSL \u2192 SKiDL \u2192 KiCad).",
